                            <h2>How ISOLDE came to be</h2>

                            <p>Our story begins back in 2011 (or thereabouts). Following my PhD and initial postdoc in
                                biomaterials research I found myself gravitating towards biochemistry and molecular
                                biology, and most recently had become very excited about some surprise observations to
                                do with insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and tissue transglutaminase (you can read
                                all about our experiments and musings on the subject <a
                                        href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167488913003248"
                                        target="_blank">here</a> and <a
                                        href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00726-011-1113-x"
                                        target="_blank">here</a>).</p>

                            <p>I suppose you can take the person out of the engineering lab but you can't take the
                                engineer out of the person... in any case, I found the biochemistry experiments alone
                                somewhat unsatisfying and really wanted to get a physical picture of what might be
                                happening. Problem 1: I had no formal training in structural biology. Problem 2: no
                                experimental structure of IGF-I bound to its receptor existed. Problem 3: in fact, no
                                structure of the full length IGF-I <em>receptor</em> existed! The closest thing
                                available was a 3.8Å crystal structure of the insulin receptor (<em>sans</em> insulin) -

                                    al., 2010</a>). Armed with a little knowledge of molecular dynamics and a

                                series of simulations aimed at finally solving the question of how insulin and IGF-I
                                bind and activate their receptors.</p>

                            <p>Needless to say, I was largely unsuccessful in this lofty goal (although <a
                                    href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06826-6" target="_blank">substantial
                                progress has since been made</a>). Rather, I was stymied by the fact that my simulations
                                kept falling apart in strange ways. One particular domain (the third fibronectin type
                                III domain, the last domain before the receptor enters the cell membrane) showed a
                                disturbing tendency to partially unfold into a largely unstructured mess. Looking more
                                closely, it began to dawn on me that certain aspects of this domain simply didn't make
                                sense (for example, an acidic sidechain buried in the hydrophobic core). Further, I
                                noticed there was a sequence mismatch in this domain compared to the canonical sequence
                                - what was modelled as Cys-Asp-Thr-Arg should, according to UniPROT, have been the very
                                different Cys-Val-Ser-Arg (this error dates back to 1985, from <a
                                        href="https://www.nature.com/articles/313756a0" target="_blank">one of the two
                                    first published sequences of the insulin receptor</a>).</p>

                            <p>While I look back on this as the turning point in my career leading me to ultimately
                                commit fully to development of structural biology methods, at the time this was all
                                something of a somewhat humbling revelation to me. Like (I suspect) many other
                                "downstream" users of experimental structures, I had been pre-disposed to treat the
                                experimental structure as <em>the</em> experimental structure - that is, the "perfect"
                                starting model used as the yardstick against which the simulation should be measured.
                                Furthermore, having never generated an electron density map (in fact, not even knowing
                                <em>how</em> to generate an electron density map) I had no real feel for what "3.8Å
                                resolution" really meant - after all, 3.8x10<sup>-10</sup> m <em>sounds</em> like a very
                                small distance to someone not used to thinking on atomic scales! I was soon to see how
                                wrong I was.</p>

                            <p>One of the first hurdles I encountered was learning how to generate an electron density
                                map from the deposited structure factors. Attempting to do so using <a
                                        href="https://www.ccp4.ac.uk/ccp4i_main.php" target="_blank"><em>CCP4i</em></a>
                                was not for the faint of heart - this was a package written by experts <em>for</em>
                                experts, and I'm afraid that without an experienced crystallographer to guide me I found
                                myself quite lost. I had much more success with the <a

                                which enabled me to finally produce my very first set of 2mFo-DFc and mFo-DFc maps.
                                Opening them in <a href="https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/" target="_blank">VMD</a>
                                led to a sobering view of the offending region much like the below:</p>

                            <p><em>cyan = 2mFo-DFc, 2.1 RMSD; red/green = mFo-DFc, +3.0 RMSD; residues shown in stick

                            </p>

                            <p>This made it quite clear that there was a serious problem here. Following the grey chain
                                from the top, what should be a hairpin coming down on the right and returning on the
                                left instead jumps the gap into its own return leg and then tails off into empty space.
                                Meanwhile, the Cys647-860 disulfide is fitted into the "turn" of the hairpin, when it
                                should in fact be one residue back - and residues 860-865 are all threaded into density
                                that should belong to the hairpin.</p>

                            <p>So, there was a clear problem. But what to do about it? As luck would have it the lead
                                crystallographer from this project, Associate Prof. Mike Lawrence, was based in
                                Melbourne - about 2,400 km from me in Brisbane (just around the corner by Australian
                                standards). After discussing the issue, we agreed to work together on addressing it
                                (with the aid of a 3.3Å dataset dating from around the same time as the data underlying
                                3LOH). After a few abortive attempts to rebuild using existing tools, I was left with a
                                much better understanding of how this error came about in the first place (I now
                                understand that such issues are far from rare at these resolutions)! However, I'd been
                                intrigued for some time about the potential of <a
                                        href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969212608001330"

                                tool - but could see that as-implemented it could never address issues like this. As it
                                happened, though, VMD had an old and largely-forgotten interactive molecular dynamics
                                (IMD) plugin, and I got to wondering what would happen if I combined the two concepts to
                                make IMDFF.</p>

                            <p>To cut a long story short, this worked even better than I had hoped - and in 2016 we
                                published <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969212616000071"

                            <p>During this two month stay in Denmark, I made a week-long side trip - a two-day visit to
                                Cambridge, and one-day visits to <a href="https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Home.html"
                                                                    target="_blank">Diamond Light Source</a> and Oxford.
                                Feedback at all three sites was very positive, and eight months later I was fortunate
                                enough to join the lab of Randy Read at the Cambridge Institute of Medical Research.</p>

                            <p>The problem I had at this stage was this: I had more than enough data and feedback to
                                show that IMDFF held serious promise - but the software I'd written to implement it was
                                cobbled together largely in my spare time, and it showed. It was a nightmare to get
                                running: requiring a custom compilation of VMD and entirely dependent upon a haptic
                                interface (the Novint Falcon) which was sadly no longer in production, it took half a
                                day at best to get installed on a new system, and I could only ever get it to work in a
                                small subset of RedHat Linux flavours. I'd already come to terms with the prospect of
                                starting over, and thanks to Randy and his postdoc Airlie McCoy I now had the time and
                                support to do it properly. Exploring options on how to get started, I settled on <a
                                        href="http://openmm.org/" target="_blank">OpenMM</a> as the back-end - a fast
                                and hyper-flexible molecular dynamics package designed specifically as a library for use
                                in MD-based applications, it was perfect for my needs. As a graphical front-end, I
                                ultimately decided upon <a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimerax/" target="_blank">ChimeraX</a>.
                                While very new at the time and still in early alpha, it was already impressive in its
                                capabilities and (of particular value to me) was designed specifically as a platform for
                                third-party plugin developers. Combined with the enthusiastic support and patient help
                                of the ChimeraX lead graphics developer, Tom Goddard, it made getting started about as
                                easy as I could have hoped.</p>

                            <p>The rest, as they say, is history. At the time I'm writing this it's two years and four
                                months since I moved to Cambridge, and ISOLDE 1.0b2 is just about to go out into the
                                wild. I hope you enjoy using it as much as I've enjoyed the journey of building it!</p>

                            <h2>Design philosophy</h2>

                            <p><em>(Disclaimer: the below describes my <strong>goals</strong></em><em> in designing
                                ISOLDE - also described in <a
                                        href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/iucr/doi/10.1107/S2059798318002425"

                                to think I'm working in the right direction)</em></p>

                            <p>If I were to sum up my goals in designing ISOLDE in a single sentence it would be this: I
                                want to help people like myself <em>circa</em> 2013 to understand and work effectively
                                with structural biology models, while also helping established experts to get the best
                                possible models out of their data with a minimum of effort.</p>

                            <p>The longer version:</p>

                            <h3>Good software works, but great software teaches</h3>

                            <p>In my opinion, good software helps experts to get their job done faster and better - but
                                <strong>great </strong>software helps its users to <em>become</em> experts in the first
                                place. In the case of scientific software, this means teaching the user about the
                                underlying science in an intuitive and accessible manner - not "dumbing it down", but
                                presenting the necessary information up-front in a way that just "makes sense", while
                                still ensuring the details are accessible to those who really need them.</p>

                            <p>An example of what I'm talking about is my handling of Ramachandran and rotamer outliers.
                                Traditionally, these have only been presented to the user "on request" - that is, as
                                part of a validation task typically run at the end of a round of refinement - and shown
                                as some combination of somewhat dry tables and 2D <em>phi/psi</em> Ramachandran plots.
                                This immediately acts as a barrier to the non-expert user - in order to make use of
                                them, the user needs to (a) know to look for them in the first place; (b) know
                                <em>where</em> to look for them; (c) know what the terms "Ramachandran outlier" and
                                "rotamer outlier" actually mean and have some grasp of their importance; and (d) know
                                how to find the offending residues in the often-bewildering sea of atoms that is a large
                                model.</p>

                            <p>Back in 2015 (published in 2016 in <a
                                    href="https://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?di5003" target="_blank">my complement
                                C4 paper with Gregers Andersen</a>) I began experimenting with a new approach: turning
                                Ramachandran validation into a real-time process, and marking it up directly on the
                                protein residues using coloured spheres centred on the alpha carbons. The video below
                                (originally submitted as supplementary information with the aforementioned paper) is the
                                first public demonstration of this (in ISOLDE, I've since extended upon it to include
                                real-time highlighting of rotamer outliers and <em>cis</em> or twisted peptide bonds).
                            </p>

                            <p>


                                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NyvVzn1kC-U" frameborder="0"
                                        allowfullscreen="true" width="500" height="500"></iframe>


                            </p>

                            <p>This approch has some major advantages. Whereas the term "Ramachandran outlier" means
                                nothing to someone who hasn't already been taught about it, the general concept "red =
                                bad, blue (or, these days, green) = good" is something that most of us learn in early
                                childhood. Seeing these directly marked up on the model immediately draws the eye to the
                                problem sites, and the real-time nature of the validation means that by simply playing
                                with the model the user quickly learns that the colour of a given C-alpha is somehow
                                related to the "twist" of the backbone either side of it. In this way understanding
                                develops naturally, so when the formerly-naive user does encounter a written description
                                of the Ramachandran plot they already have the physical understanding to take it on
                                board.</p>

                            <p>This philosophy also drives my decisions in designing ISOLDE's GUI control panel. I avoid
                                text menus as much as possible, opting for visually-meaningful icons (with helpful
                                tooltips, of course) for common tasks. Additionally, I try to keep even the number of
                                icons to a minimum: rather than adding every possible function I can think of (and hence
                                burying the truly useful ones amongst a confusing sea of rarely-used options) the GUI
                                should provide a set of carefully chosen and well-tuned buttons sufficient to cover the
                                range of "workhorse" tasks. This brings me to my next major design goal:</p>

                            <h3>Trivial problems should be fixed in trivial time</h3>

                            <p>The vast majority of errors in any given model of reasonable resolution are quite trivial
                                (not in their impact if left unaddressed, which can of course be quite serious, but in
                                the scale of the change required to fix them). A peptide bond flip, say, or an incorrect
                                rotamer only requires the concerted movement of a handful of atoms - and once seen it's
                                often quite obvious how they need to move. Ideally, it should never be necessary for the
                                user to spend more than a few seconds on each such case - and, of course, as many as
                                possible should sort themselves out without any user intervention at all!</p>

                                entwine together forever after - a bittersweet, but poetic ending to the story. In the
                                logo, the "trees" are in fact intertwined RNA chains from the core of a ribosome. The
                                background is from the south island of New Zealand, taken on a cold and frosty morning
                                on a lonely mountain pass (Crown Range Rd west of Queenstown, looking towards the
                                Remarkables) during my honeymoon in 2006.</p>

                            <p>ISOLDE would not have come to be if it weren't for the help and support of a great many
                                people. First up is <a href="https://www.wehi.edu.au/people/mike-lawrence"
                                                       target="_blank">Mike Lawrence</a>, who not only took me seriously
                                when I contacted him regarding what I'd found in his insulin receptor structure, but was
                                incredibly patient with my initial mis-steps as I learned the ins and outs of how
                                crystallographic refinement works. Then there are <a
                                        href="https://scmb.uq.edu.au/profile/984/bostjan-kobe" target="_blank">Bostjan

                                a wide range of people in the structural biology community both locally and abroad
                                leading to quite a few productive collaborations on challenging structures. The gang at

                            <p>On the software side of things, ISOLDE is well and truly built upon the shoulders of
                                giants. First up, of course, is the <a
                                        href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/Overview/staff.html" target="_blank">ChimeraX
                                    team</a> - in particular Tom Goddard and Eric Pettersen. It's fair to say that I
                                wouldn't have gotten half as far as I have with ISOLDE without their help and advice
                                (and often amazingly prompt responses to bug reports and feature requests). <a
                                        href="http://openmm.org/" target="_blank">OpenMM</a> is also amazing, to the
                                point where in most respects it may as well have been custom built for my specific
                                application. For handling crystallographic data, Kevin Cowtan's <a
                                        href="http://www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/~cowtan/clipper/clipper.html" target="_blank">Clipper</a>
                                library is a clean, thoroughly-documented, logical, highly modular and compact C++ API
                                that makes many complex tasks fast and easy. The <a
                                        href="http://molprobity.biochem.duke.edu/" target="_blank">MolProbity team at
                                    Duke</a> have put a huge amount of painstaking work over many into collecting what I
                                think are the most accurate structural validation datasets in existence, and summarising
                                them into clear metrics. A special shout-out to Jane Richardson, not just for a great
                                many discussions but for helping to really nail down a distinctive look for ISOLDE's
                                Ramachandran plots in one afternoon during the 2017 PHENIX meeting in Santa Fe:</p>

                            <p>I of course need to make a big shout-out to <a href="http://www.phenix-online.org/"
                                                                              target="_blank">PHENIX</a> (and, in
                                particular, the PHENIX GUI) - a great example of software that teaches rather than just
                                facilitates. If I hadn't found it as a newcomer to the field back in 2013, it would have
                                taken me <em>far</em> longer to get up and running.</p>

                            <p>Finally, I couldn't have done this without the support of my long-suffering wife - for
                                her patience during the many mornings, evenings and weekends I spent buried in code
                                or choreographing atoms; for putting up with my occasional spending personal funds on
                                high-end development laptops and travel for demos; and, of course, for agreeing to move
                                the family to the far side of the planet chasing a dream.</p>

                            <p>* As one reviewer on my <em>Acta D </em>manuscript on ISOLDE kindly pointed out, this is
                                a somewhat morbid precedent upon which to base the name of one's software. I just
                                couldn't resist, though - like said reviewer, I just hope the Universe has enough of a
                                sense of humour to overlook my tempting of fate in this instance.</p>
