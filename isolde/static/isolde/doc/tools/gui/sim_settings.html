<p>Assuming your model meets the requirements (that is, all residues are complete
with hydrogens and known to the MD forcefield), then starting a simulation is as
simple as making a selection of atoms in the main ChimeraX window and clicking
the play button on the left-hand side of the ISOLDE ribbon menu:</p>
<figure class="align-default">
<img alt="../../_images/start_sim_button.png" src="../../_images/start_sim_button.png" />
</figure>
<p>Your selection may be anything from a single atom to all atoms in the model.
ISOLDE will automatically expand this to give a soft “buffer zone” around your
region of interest. For the sake of performance your selection should be as
small as necessary to achieve the desired goal. Of course, the larger the
selection the slower the simulation.</p>
<p>The selection size you can make while still achieving reasonably interactive
performance is primarily dependent on your GPU (which does essentially all of
the hard work of running the simulation). On a modern Nvidia RTX GPU, you
should be able to run simulations up to about 1000 mobile residues before
performance becomes seriously constraining. Note that <em>graphics</em> performance
(that is, responsiveness of the display when rotating, translating, zooming
etc.) is only weakly affected by simulation size, and remains above 30 fps
under most circumstances. At the other end of the scale, small onboard GPUs
such as those found in pre-M1 MacBooks manage surprisingly well, providing
usably interactive performance for a few dozen mobile residues. If you have
good-quality data (better than about 3 Angstroms resolution), you can get
significantly improved performance at the expense of less realistic
electrostatic interactions by choosing the Lowest/Fastest option in
the “Sim Fidelity/Speed” widget on ISOLDE’s General tab.</p>
<p>The maximum sized model that will successfully run <strong>non</strong> interactively is a
function of the amount of RAM available to your GPU (built-in RAM in dedicated
GPUs; system RAM for on-motherboard GPUs). See <a class="reference internal" href="../requirements.html#system-requirements"><span class="std std-ref">System Requirements</span></a> for
more details. <em>(NOTE: for extremely large models and/or low-end hardware, initial
energy minimisation of the entire model can take anywhere up to tens of minutes.
Please be patient - once you see the atoms start moving it is safe to stop the
simulation and continue working with more manageable selections)</em></p>

<section id="dealing-with-severe-clashes">
<span id="dealing-with-clashes"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5" role="doc-backlink">Dealing with severe clashes</a><a class="headerlink" href="#dealing-with-severe-clashes" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Before you go ahead and start a simulation, it’s generally a very good idea to
do some basic sanity checks (if you skip these ISOLDE will generally back out
gracefully if it runs into trouble, but it’s best to get in ahead). The most
important check is for severe clashes of the kind that cannot resolve gracefully.
As an example, a clash like this:</p>
<figure class="align-default">
<img alt="../../_images/ok_clash.jpg" src="../../_images/ok_clash.jpg" />
</figure>
<p>... will generally be handled well, since there is a clear “downhill” path
for the minimiser to push the clashing atoms apart. On the other hand, extreme
clashes - particularly those with residues passing through each other like this:</p>
<figure class="align-default">
<img alt="../../_images/catastrophic_clash.jpg" src="../../_images/catastrophic_clash.jpg" />
</figure>
<p>... will generally require some more careful treatment. Because there is no
straightforward path out of the tangle, naive energy minimisation will generally
lead to a ridiculous tangle akin to this:</p>
<figure class="align-default">
<img alt="../../_images/mess_caused_by_severe_clashes.jpg" src="../../_images/mess_caused_by_severe_clashes.jpg" />
</figure>
<p>Clashes can be found using the Clashes widget on ISOLDE’s Validation tab:</p>
<figure class="align-default">
<img alt="../../_images/clashes_widget.png" src="../../_images/clashes_widget.png" />
</figure>
<p>If your inspection does identify particularly severe clashes like the above
(a particularly common hazard when starting from a model composed of multiple
independently rigid-body docked fragments), then the best approach is typically
to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>restrain with local distance and torsion restraints (see <a class="reference internal" href="rebuild.html#reference-model-restraints"><span class="std std-ref">Reference Models</span></a>);</p></li>
<li><p>start a simulation encompassing a region large enough to allow the clashing
components to separate (i.e. if two domains are clashing, select at least the
entirety of one of the clashing domains);</p></li>
<li><p>use the Nonbonded Potentials widget found on the General tab to gradually
reduce the strength of the van der Waals and electrostatic interactions until
the clashing atoms are able to slide past each other;</p></li>
<li><p>if necessary, use the “tug selection” mouse mode to help the clashing regions
separate;</p></li>
<li><p>return the nonbonded potentials to their default strength and move on.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For a worked example of the above, see the interactive <a class="reference internal" href="../../tutorials/intro/clashes/clashes.html#isolde-clashes-tutorial"><span class="std std-ref">Dealing with severe clashes</span></a>
tutorial.</p>
<p>When faced with extremely large overlaps between domains, you might find it useful
to start by using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">isolde</span> <span class="pre">ignore</span> <span class="pre">{selection}</span></code> command to temporarily exclude
some residues from simulations, allowing you to move the others without resistance.
If you take that route, remember you can reinstate residues for future simulations
with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">isolde</span> <span class="pre">~ignore</span></code>. For more information, see <a class="reference internal" href="../../commands/isolde.html#ignore"><span class="std std-ref">isolde ignore</span></a>.</p>

<section id="dealing-with-unrecognised-residues">
<span id="unrecognised-residues"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6" role="doc-backlink">Dealing with unrecognised residues</a><a class="headerlink" href="#dealing-with-unrecognised-residues" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>If ISOLDE encounters a residue it does not recognise while preparing a
simulation, a dialog box like the following will appear:</p>
<figure class="align-default">
<img alt="Unrecognised residue error dialog box" src="../../_images/unrecognised_residue_error.png" />
</figure>
<p>On clicking OK ISOLDE will open and populate the “Unparameterised Residues”
widget on its Validation tab:</p>
<figure class="align-default">
<img alt="../../_images/unparam_residues_widget.png" src="../../_images/unparam_residues_widget.png" />
</figure>
<p>Clicking on an entry in the top table will show the offending residue in the
main GUI, and bring up a list of known templates matching by name or similar
topology in the bottom table. In most cases where there is a matching entry in
the bottom table (typically where the residue has a known template but is
unrecognised simply due to missing atoms or incorrect hydrogenation) you can
correct it by by simply clicking “Rebuild residue to template”. If no template
is found, that’s not necessarily the end of the world: if your residue is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>not covalently bound to any other residue; and</p></li>
<li><p>composed only of the elements C, N, O, S, P, H, F, Cl, Br, and/or I; and</p></li>
<li><p>not a radical</p></li>
</ul>
<p>... then you should be able to generate parameters using the “Residue
Parameterisation” widget on ISOLDE’s General tab:</p>
<figure class="align-default">
<img alt="../../_images/param_widget.png" src="../../_images/param_widget.png" />
</figure>
<p><strong>(NOTE: It is critically important that you make sure the residue is correct
including all hydrogens before you parameterise it)</strong></p>
<p>If you have existing AMBER-compatible parameters in the <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.openmm.org/7.0.0/userguide/application.html#creating-force-fields">OpenMM ffXML format</a>
you can also load them here.</p>
<p>If your ligand/residue does not meet the above criteria but is already well-fitted in the
density, you can still continue on by selecting it and entering the command
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">isolde</span> <span class="pre">ignore</span> <span class="pre">sel</span></code>. As far as ISOLDE’s simulations are concerned it will no
longer exist (any parameterised residues that covalently bind to it will exist but
will be fixed in space). Note that this means there is nothing to stop surrounding
atoms falling into its density - take extra care in this region. If it is <em>not</em>
well fitted, it may be more sensible to delete it for now and add it back once the
surroundings are correctly built and refined.</p>

<p>As mentioned at the top of this page, once your model meets all the requirements
for successful simulation you can get things moving by clicking the “Start simulation”
button on ISOLDE’s ribbon menu:</p>
<figure class="align-default">
<img alt="../../_images/start_sim_button.png" src="../../_images/start_sim_button.png" />
</figure>
<p>On successful start, this button will change to a pause button and the adjacent
control buttons will become activated:</p>
<figure class="align-default">
<img alt="../../_images/sim_control_buttons.png" src="../../_images/sim_control_buttons.png" />
</figure>
<p>The next two icons (the green and red chequered flags) to the right allow you to
save and restore, respectively, a snapshot of the model state. These are
generally used when you want to test a hypothesis - i.e. make a substantial
rearrangement where you’re not sure if it will be successful. Click the green
button to store the current coordinates and the states of all relevant
restraints, try your rearrangement, and if it fails, click the red button to put
things back as they were. If you haven’t clicked the green button, clicking the
red one will restore the simulation to the state it was in when you clicked
“Start simulation”.</p>
<p>The final two icons (green and red stop signs) are your two choices for stopping
the simulation. The green icon keeps your work, and is the one that you should
be using almost all the time. The red icon discards everything you did in this
simulation, reverting the model to the way it was when you clicked “Start
simulation”.</p>

<p>With your simulation running, <strong>right-click-and-drag</strong> on any heavy atom and
you should see it follow your mouse cursor, with a 3D green arrow showing the
direction of pull:</p>
<figure class="align-default" id="id3">
<img alt="Tugging on a single atom" src="../../_images/tugging.png" />
<figcaption>
<p><span class="caption-text">Interactive tugging forces are shown like this green arrow</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id3" title="Permalink to this image">¶</a></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>ISOLDE offers two other tugging modes, which you can set during simulations
using buttons on the far right of ISOLDE’s ribbon menu:</p>
<figure class="align-default">
<img alt="ISOLDE's tugging modes toolbar" src="../../_images/tugging_toolbar.png" />
</figure>
<p>The “tug atom” mouse mode is set every time a simulation starts. You can still
use the buttons on the ChimeraX mouse modes toolbar to make the right mouse
button do other things, and come back to tugging using the above buttons. Just
avoid anything that actually adds or removes atoms while your simulation is
running - and <strong>never</strong> use these three mouse modes to move a model initialised
for ISOLDE:</p>

<section id="adjusting-map-weightings">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9" role="doc-backlink">Adjusting map weightings</a><a class="headerlink" href="#adjusting-map-weightings" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>When any qualifying map is associated with the currently selected model, ISOLDE
automatically prepares it for MDFF and guesses a suitable weighting constant
(see <a class="reference internal" href="getting_started.html#adding-maps"><span class="std std-ref">Adding maps</span></a>). The algorithm used for this assumes that at least a
substantial portion of the model is correctly docked in the map, and is not strictly
deterministic:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>For each non-hydrogen atom in the model, a random position is chosen
near the atom centre (perturbed up to +/-0.25 Angstroms along each axis),
and the map gradient at that point is calculated by trilinear interpolation.</p></li>
<li><p>The resulting gradients are ranked in increasing order of magnitude, and
the 90th percentile gradient is found.</p></li>
<li><p>The coupling constant is chosen such that (coupling constant) *
(90th percentile gradient) = (a heuristically determined scaling
constant).</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The default weighting tends to work well for models with resolutions better than
about 3.5 Angstroms. Beyond that you may find it to be too strong (symptoms of
this are backbone atoms twisting out of stable secondary structure geometry,
and/or sidechains being “sucked” overly aggressively into the map). If you wish
to adjust the weighting, you can do so at any time using the relevant Map
Settings widget on ISOLDE’s General tab.</p>
</section>
<section id="adjusting-temperature-and-trajectory-smoothing">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10" role="doc-backlink">Adjusting temperature and trajectory smoothing</a><a class="headerlink" href="#adjusting-temperature-and-trajectory-smoothing" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Molecular dynamics simulations are designed to closely replicate real-world
behaviour of molecules, including random thermal motion. The default simulation
temperature is 20 Kelvin - enough to give you a clear indication of motion and
help the model “rattle” itself into density, without being overwhelming. In order
to reduce the “jittery” effect, ISOLDE performs continuous trajectory smoothing
on the coordinates you see <em>(NOTE: the level of smoothing does not affect the
simulation itself)</em>. You can adjust the simulation temperature and smoothing
using the “Simulation Runtime” widget on ISOLDE’s General tab:</p>
<figure class="align-default">
<img alt="Temperature and trajectory smoothing controls" src="../../_images/sim_runtime_widget.png" />
</figure>
<p>Once the model is very close to finished it is a good idea to reduce the temperature
to zero Kelvin to remove thermal fluctuation and allow the local geometry to
settle to equilibrium.</p>
<p>Anyway, once you are able to successfully start simulations, you
can move on to <a class="reference internal" href="rebuild.html#manipulating-your-model"><span class="std std-ref">Manipulating your model</span></a>.</p>
